# Programming for Data Analytics 

Author: Irene Kilgannon

Student ID: G00220627

This is my repository for the semester two module, Programming for Data Analytics for a [Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics) at [Atlantic Technological University](https://www.atu.ie/).

The repository contains three directories:

- PFDA-mywork
- PFDA-assignments
- PFDA-project

## PFDA-mywork

The PFDA-mywork directory contains the lab work that is associated with the weekly lectures.

## PFDA-assignments

Five assignments were set. Submission date 16th December 2024. 

These assignments were:

- Assignment 1
    - Create a repository for the module, [my repository](https://github.com/IreneKilgannon/PFDA).

- assignment2-weather.ipynb
    - Using the csv file in the [assignment folder](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/assignment/weatherreadings1.csv) of the [PFDA-courseware repository](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware) create a nice plot of the temperature over time.
    - Use the 'dryBulbTemperature_Celsius' column.

- assignment03-pie.ipynb
    - A nice pie chart of the email domains in the csv file at the following [url](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download).

- assignment_5_risk.ipynb
    - A program that simulates 1000 individual battle rounds of Risk (3 attacker vs 2 defender) and plots the result.
    - For extra marks: a more complicated version that simulates a full series of rounds for armies of arbitrary sizes, until one side is wiped out and plots the results.

- assignment_6_Weather.ipynb
    - Using the data from this link, https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv
        - Plot:
            * The temperature
            * The mean temperature each day
            * The mean temperature for each month
            * The wind speed
            * The rolling wind speed (say over 24 hours)
            * The max wind speed for each day
            * The monthly mean of the daily max wind speeds

## PFDA-project

The project aims:

* Analyse wind energy production in the Republic of Ireland. 
* Examine the influence the weather has on wind energy production.
* Create a machine learning model that can predict the wind energy output based on weather data.
* Create a simple forecasting model to predict the wind energy.

PFDA-project contains the following Jupyter notebooks and directories:

|Name|Contents|
|---|---|
|data |.csv files for weather and electricity|
|img|.png image files||
|plots|plots|
|wind_energy_analysis.ipynb|The project notebook analysing wind energy and weather. |
|weather_trends.ipynb|Analysis of long term weather trends focussing on wind speeds.|
|clean_weather.ipynb|Cleaning and merging of weather data for analysis. |
|clean_wind_electricity.ipynb|Cleaning and merging of wind energy data for analysis. |
|util.py|Module with Python functions|


## Installation

To run the file on your local system, the following must be downloaded and installed.

1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Anaconda is a Python distribution and comes with pre-installed packages. Please note that when installing Anaconda, it is important to check the two boxes for:
  * Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable.
  * Register Anaconda3 as my default.

2. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

4. Install [Cmder](https://cmder.app/)

5. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com). 

## Usage

With Cmder (or in the terminal of Visual Studio Code) enter the following to clone the repository from GitHub onto your own machine:
  
    ``git clone https://github.com/IreneKilgannon/PFDA.git``

## To Run the Assignments

The assignment files are all Jupyter notebooks and can be run in Visual Studio Code by clicking the Run All button. Ensure that the python3 kernel has been selected before running the file. 

## To Run the Project

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) can be used to run the project if your machine struggles with the large data sets in this project.
