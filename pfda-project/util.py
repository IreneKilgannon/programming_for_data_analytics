    ''' A function to read multiple files matching a glob expression into a single Pandas DataFrame. 
    It processes the data by performing several transformations and outputs the result as a CSV file.

    Arguments:
        file_path: A file path with glob expressions to specify the files to read.

        names: A list of column names for the DataFrame. 

        usecols: The columns to include in the DataFrame.
